My first Git project
====================
We set up a virtual development environment using vagrant
for provisioning our LAMP stack. The tools we're developing
with are as follows:

1. Linux (hasicorp/precise32)
2. php 7.0
3. Mysql
4. Nginx
5. phpmyadmin

Ensure you use virtual box as your provider
Enjoj!
